    User Story: AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
    ---5 day forecast
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    ---bootstrap form?
WHEN I search for a city
    --searchable fields
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    ---search for cities weather using API

        ---save search history to local storage
            ---weather needs to visibly show
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    ---API(open weathermap.org??)
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
    --retrieve local storage
